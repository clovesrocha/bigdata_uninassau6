00:00:27.518 --> 00:00:34.827
CodeCombat Team: I'm also a former educator who understands the demands of the educator role, so I'm always happy to help our educators.


4
00:00:34.998 --> 00:00:37.258
CodeCombat Team: Now, I'll let Noah introduce himself.


5
00:00:38.438 --> 00:01:03.397
CodeCombat Team: Thanks, Gabby. Hi, everyone. My name's Noah, and similar to Gabby, I'm a School Success Manager here at Code Combat. I've spent the last few years supporting educators like yourselves drive lasting results in their classrooms, and I actually come from a background of support here at the company, so I've been given a unique opportunity to get to know our products inside and out, and I'm so excited to share how you can leverage our new AI Hackstack program in each of your classrooms today. If you do have any questions after this webinar.


6
00:01:03.398 --> 00:01:07.547
CodeCombat Team: please don't hesitate to reach out to us at AI at codecombat.com.


7
00:01:10.088 --> 00:01:34.668
CodeCombat Team: So, a little bit about our company. Code Combat was founded over 10 years ago, and although we are a small team, we serve a lot of students and teachers across the globe. You'll notice that we've now engaged over 20 million engaged students. We have 1 billion lines of code to date that's been coded, with 320,000 supported educators and 75,000 schools reached, 190 plus countries and 5.2 million


8
00:01:34.758 --> 00:01:39.527
CodeCombat Team: esports players in our AI Esports League, so all very exciting stats for us.


9
00:01:42.068 --> 00:02:06.307
CodeCombat Team: So before we dive into things, we want to let you know you will receive a certificate of completion for today's webinar. More specifically, you will earn the certificate by responding to all of our poll questions today. I'm sorry, they're going to be scattered throughout the webinar, and there's going to be four in total, so you will receive your certificate of completion in an email after the webinar is concluded, but please don't hesitate to let us know if you need another form of confirmation to verify


10
00:02:06.308 --> 00:02:10.838
CodeCombat Team: These, professional development hours for licensing purposes in your state or district.


11
00:02:13.168 --> 00:02:20.098
CodeCombat Team: So we believe that in order to use AI Hackstack effectively, it helps to know a little bit about what AI is and where we can find it in the world.


12
00:02:22.098 --> 00:02:32.617
CodeCombat Team: Here's our first poll for today. You should see a poll pop-up screen in just a second here, but we want to know which of the following is not an example of AI?


13
00:02:32.668 --> 00:02:44.458
CodeCombat Team: Is it A autocorrect in text documents, B, GPS navigation, C, a search engine like Google, or D, a barcode scanner at a store?


14
00:02:45.998 --> 00:02:49.458
CodeCombat Team: Gonna give you a few moments to answer.


15
00:02:52.638 --> 00:03:07.738
CodeCombat Team: Okay, it looks like most of us got this right. The correct answer is a barcode scanner at the store is not an example of AI. All of the other options are examples of AI, some of which have been around for quite some time.


16
00:03:11.788 --> 00:03:12.468
CodeCombat Team: Oops.


17
00:03:15.978 --> 00:03:40.387
CodeCombat Team: So we like to define AI as software… oh, let's close those results out real quick. So we like to define AI as software that can perform tasks typically completed by a human. This means that a lot of things can be an example of AI. For example, robots dancing is an example of AI, or the ghost chasing Pac-Man is another example of AI. So being able to define the term can help you identify it in the world, which is the first step to critically using AI products like AI Hackstack.


18
00:03:40.388 --> 00:03:44.207
CodeCombat Team: So with that in mind, can anyone describe more examples of AI in the chat?


19
00:03:50.078 --> 00:03:53.258
CodeCombat Team: I'll give you a few moments to put some responses down.


20
00:03:56.998 --> 00:03:58.968
CodeCombat Team: Sure. So…


21
00:03:59.328 --> 00:04:19.297
CodeCombat Team: AI, essentially, we like to think of it as software that can perform tasks typically completed by a human. So that means that a lot of things can be examples of AI. So, for example, robots dancing would be an example of AI, or those ghosts in Pac-Man that chase Pac-Man would be an example. So with those examples in mind, can anyone else come up with any other examples in the chat below?


22
00:04:21.738 --> 00:04:23.867
CodeCombat Team: Yeah, an AI video generator.


23
00:04:24.568 --> 00:04:29.228
CodeCombat Team: ChatGPT, it's definitely a great example of AI. Or Alexa.


24
00:04:33.308 --> 00:04:35.958
CodeCombat Team: Yeah, self-driving cars, that's another great example.


25
00:04:39.398 --> 00:04:41.947
CodeCombat Team: Awesome. Thanks, guys, for all your responses.


26
00:04:44.588 --> 00:04:57.917
CodeCombat Team: Right, so now that we know a little bit more about AI, it's time to see how you can effectively use AI Hackstack in the classroom. We're going to go through a typical teacher's workflow when using Hackstack in its curriculum.


27
00:05:00.548 --> 00:05:14.597
CodeCombat Team: So the first thing you will need to do is set up your first AI Hackstack class. This is where you can assign levels to your students to complete in Hackstack. When you create a class, make sure that you select AI Hackstack as your initial course.


28
00:05:14.788 --> 00:05:26.548
CodeCombat Team: We're gonna share our screen to show you how to do that, and then once your educator account is created on coldcombat.com, you'll go to your, Cold Combat Teacher Dashboard.


29
00:05:28.958 --> 00:05:32.577
CodeCombat Team: Once you're there, you'll select Add New Class.


30
00:05:34.958 --> 00:05:48.037
CodeCombat Team: In the pop-up that appears, there is an option to import your students via Google Classroom or via your Azaria Classroom, if you already have a class set up in our other coding program, or you can enter the details manually.


31
00:05:48.198 --> 00:05:51.457
CodeCombat Team: When doing it manually, you'll create a class name.


32
00:05:52.328 --> 00:05:56.147
CodeCombat Team: You'll then select the initial courses you want students to start with.


33
00:05:56.628 --> 00:06:11.348
CodeCombat Team: Here you'll see the Code Combat Junior option, which is designed for the elementary learner, the Code Combat Introduction to Computer Science option, that's designed for secondary students. These are two of three of Code Combat's core platforms that teach coding.


34
00:06:11.358 --> 00:06:23.627
CodeCombat Team: You'll also see the AI Hackstack option. So teachers have an ability to select all of the options for the initial courses when relevant. However, for this presentation, we're just going to select AI Hack Stack.


35
00:06:23.948 --> 00:06:32.308
CodeCombat Team: And then we don't have to worry about choosing a programming language for AI Hackstat, because it defaults to JavaScript. So now we'll click Create Class.


36
00:06:33.647 --> 00:06:38.867
CodeCombat Team: And then once you create a class, it'll show in a list under all classes.


37
00:06:39.718 --> 00:06:44.607
CodeCombat Team: For this presentation, we're going to use our demo class to show you our teacher dashboard.


38
00:06:47.518 --> 00:06:53.847
CodeCombat Team: So, jumping into the class, You'll notice once it loads here….


39
00:06:54.018 --> 00:06:58.897
CodeCombat Team: Sorry, give me a second, Gabby. Are we having trouble seeing this screen here?


40
00:07:01.088 --> 00:07:03.627
CodeCombat Team: Can everyone see the teacher dashboard?


41
00:07:05.378 --> 00:07:07.498
CodeCombat Team: Okay, perfect. Just wanted to make sure.


42
00:07:07.698 --> 00:07:19.748
CodeCombat Team: Thank you. So you'll see the student roster on the left-hand side of your screen when students are enrolled in the class. From this dashboard, you can easily apply and revoke student licenses.


43
00:07:19.768 --> 00:07:37.437
CodeCombat Team: And remove students by selecting all students or individual students, and choosing the operation you want to perform. The dashboard is very user-friendly. There are also progress bubbles where you can easily keep track of how your students are progressing through the content from the dashboard.


44
00:07:37.438 --> 00:07:41.898
CodeCombat Team: Progress bubbles for activities are clickable, so you can view students' work.


45
00:07:42.378 --> 00:07:44.867
CodeCombat Team: And even view their project submissions.


46
00:07:46.078 --> 00:08:07.978
CodeCombat Team: You can also lock content from here, so entire modules can be locked at a time from the dashboard by simply hovering over the lock icon and locking or unlocking that module. Locking content can be useful if you are following our lesson plans, want to pause students from getting too far ahead, or want to pause students to review important concepts.


47
00:08:08.298 --> 00:08:10.897
CodeCombat Team: So now let's jump into the curriculum.


48
00:08:15.168 --> 00:08:24.778
CodeCombat Team: So, in the Curriculum Guide tab, there are 9 modules that are categorized into different themes and subjects to allow students to explore AI in different content areas.


49
00:08:24.828 --> 00:08:41.058
CodeCombat Team: Currently, everyone has access to the first module for free. If you're interested in trying more of the curriculum, please don't hesitate to reach out to us at AI at coldcombat.com. We'll make sure that you can check out the rest. Now, let's dive into the first lesson in AI Hackstack.


50
00:08:43.768 --> 00:09:01.808
CodeCombat Team: So, our slides are student-facing and designed to help guide… to help you guide the class through each lesson. As we dive into the first lesson in the AI Hackstack curriculum, be sure to check the notes section on the title slides. These notes include helpful guidance and talking points to support your instruction.


51
00:09:07.838 --> 00:09:21.878
CodeCombat Team: Today's journey slide shows the agenda. Notice the structure of this lesson. Learn, remix, create. This is the structure that will… that you will find in all of the lessons, no matter the topic being taught within the lesson.


52
00:09:24.378 --> 00:09:34.578
CodeCombat Team: Students are given the goals of that day's lesson. This slide is important because it helps create purpose, focus, and motivation in the learning process for the lesson.


53
00:09:37.998 --> 00:09:55.928
CodeCombat Team: Note the slide's objective is highlighted at the top of each slide. As we've seen, Lesson 1 is broken down into five parts, chat, learn, remix, create, and close. It starts with three Let's Chat questions that help students explore the topic together in a structured, thoughtful way.


54
00:09:55.928 --> 00:10:03.027
CodeCombat Team: These conversations are designed to deepen understanding, encourage students to make connections, and build critical thinking skills.


55
00:10:03.058 --> 00:10:15.747
CodeCombat Team: This is an example, and another… then this is just another reminder for me. Be sure to check out the notes section on each slide. That's where we've added helpful talking points and guidance to support you as you lead the lesson.


56
00:10:16.208 --> 00:10:19.077
CodeCombat Team: And now we're just gonna jump into presenter mode.


57
00:10:19.178 --> 00:10:21.958
CodeCombat Team: And show you the slides as the students would see them.


58
00:10:22.408 --> 00:10:41.648
CodeCombat Team: So, as the lesson progresses, we'll transition into the learn phase. This is where students dive into the AI Hackstack program. The platform guides them step-by-step through activities we've designed to help them use AI effectively. In this particular activity, students will be learning how to use AI to create a game.


59
00:10:43.978 --> 00:11:00.037
CodeCombat Team: After students are in the program and completed the learn phase, they'll debrief. You can do a think, pair, and share here small group discussion, or a whole class discussion. This allows students to engage with the material, think critically, and apply what they're learning in real time.


60
00:11:02.238 --> 00:11:14.817
CodeCombat Team: Next, students move into the remix part of the lesson. This phase still provides guidance, but gives them a bit more freedom to experiment and start bringing in their own ideas while learning to use AI more effectively.


61
00:11:17.118 --> 00:11:21.747
CodeCombat Team: After completing the remix activity, there are more discussion slides.


62
00:11:23.688 --> 00:11:30.467
CodeCombat Team: In this lesson, there is even a student-led Socratic seminar where students engage in a thoughtful discussion.


63
00:11:36.018 --> 00:11:47.737
CodeCombat Team: Here's the question for this lesson. These student-led conversations aim to shift the classroom to a student-centered inquiry, helping students become more thoughtful, engaged, and articulate learners.


64
00:11:49.828 --> 00:11:59.978
CodeCombat Team: Now students move into the create phase of the lesson. This is another way to formatively assess students. Here, they can put everything they've learned so far into practice.


65
00:12:03.638 --> 00:12:12.777
CodeCombat Team: After students create their game in this lesson, they get a chance to show off their work to their peers and provide feedback, promoting a collaborative classroom culture.


66
00:12:16.348 --> 00:12:21.538
CodeCombat Team: After the gallery walk, there are more discussion slides. Here's an example of one that follows.


67
00:12:24.708 --> 00:12:33.858
CodeCombat Team: And we know that understanding vocabulary using the industry is important, so here students are given important vocabulary terms they should know in the context of the lesson.


68
00:12:37.118 --> 00:12:56.818
CodeCombat Team: At the end of a lesson, there are wrap-up questions. This lesson has 3 wrap-up questions, and here's an example. The wrap-up questions are formative assessments to assess students' understanding of the lesson. These questions can be answered as a whole group discussion, think-pair-share, small group, and even given in the form of exit tickets.


69
00:13:00.378 --> 00:13:25.107
CodeCombat Team: That takes us to the end of the first lesson, where you could see the standards that is tied to this particular lesson. So I hope that this was helpful, and as you can see, the lesson has students moving in and out of the AI Hackstack program in a structured way. The activities are designed to help them learn how to use AI effectively, while also encouraging peer learning, supporting critical thinking, and building confidence along the way.


70
00:13:25.108 --> 00:13:28.538
CodeCombat Team: Now, let's hop back into the presentation.


71
00:13:33.138 --> 00:13:52.638
CodeCombat Team: Each lesson in its entirety is estimated to take about 5 class sessions. We recommend you use the lessons as much as you can because they contain important discussion and debate prompts within them because of the newness of AI. Discussion is one of the best ways to help students formulate their own ideas and opinions about AI.


72
00:13:52.788 --> 00:14:06.757
CodeCombat Team: We also support a self-paced use of AI has set. Each, learn, remix, create set of levels is estimated to take about 2 hours of time. Now we're going to share our screen and show you the actual pacing guide.


73
00:14:12.498 --> 00:14:29.868
CodeCombat Team: So, this is our AI Hacks That Pacing Guide. What you're looking at right now is the one-year pacing overview. If you scroll down, you'll find a more detailed breakdown of the lessons. There are also two tabs at the bottom of the page. If you're looking for a semester-length, self-paced plan instead, just click that option.


74
00:14:29.868 --> 00:14:34.918
CodeCombat Team: So, this pacing guide can be found in the Getting Started folder, in the teacher


75
00:14:34.918 --> 00:14:38.427
CodeCombat Team: Toolkit, and it can help you structure your classes.


76
00:14:43.138 --> 00:14:59.217
CodeCombat Team: And we also know that assessments are important, so we have added both a formative and summative assessments to every lesson and module. Each lesson contains four formative assessments, wrap-up exit ticket questions for each learning objective, and one mini-project prompt.


77
00:14:59.348 --> 00:15:03.718
CodeCombat Team: The mini project is the create step of the Learn, Remix, Create.


78
00:15:03.868 --> 00:15:10.217
CodeCombat Team: Every module contains an open-ended project that you can use to assess your student's overall mastery of the topics.


79
00:15:10.468 --> 00:15:16.028
CodeCombat Team: We have included exemplar projects and rubrics to help you implement these in your classrooms.


80
00:15:18.848 --> 00:15:37.137
CodeCombat Team: Finally, you can use the teacher dashboard to highlight the progress and safety of your students. Although we prevent your students from requesting inappropriate things in Hackstead, we provide you with a log of those requests. This can be useful when you are having conversations with families and administrators and students.


81
00:15:37.208 --> 00:15:49.737
CodeCombat Team: We also have many data agreements with the big AI companies, so they cannot legally save your student data. We also have filters in place to remove PII if it is accidentally included within the prompt.


82
00:15:50.028 --> 00:16:00.507
CodeCombat Team: Finally, you can always lock levels if you feel uncomfortable with your students using a particular model. Now we're going to share our screen and show you what the flag system looks like.


83
00:16:05.358 --> 00:16:25.788
CodeCombat Team: So we're going now to the teacher dashboard to show you how you'll be able to detect when a student submits an inappropriate prompt. A violation can be identified when a red square appears around a circle. By clicking on the flag circle, you can view more about that violation. Here's a case where a student attempted to create a game containing crashing language and inappropriate content.


84
00:16:25.788 --> 00:16:32.078
CodeCombat Team: When a violation occurs, our AI program will block the prompt instead of executing the instruction.


85
00:16:32.078 --> 00:16:36.788
CodeCombat Team: The student must revise and submit an appropriate prompt in order to proceed.


86
00:16:36.848 --> 00:16:43.858
CodeCombat Team: You may also view the full project by clicking the Open Project button located below the list of safety violations.


87
00:16:45.218 --> 00:16:56.107
CodeCombat Team: So, ultimately, we hope these safety features provide peace of mind and enable you to confidently monitor your students as they learn to use AI responsibly.


88
00:16:56.348 --> 00:16:59.598
CodeCombat Team: Now we're hopping back to the presentation.


89
00:17:00.368 --> 00:17:06.437
CodeCombat Team: And it's time for another poll here. There's no right or wrong answer.


90
00:17:08.428 --> 00:17:11.217
CodeCombat Team: I'm just gonna launch that for you.


91
00:17:11.468 --> 00:17:14.327
CodeCombat Team: So, we just want to note your…


92
00:17:14.818 --> 00:17:33.287
CodeCombat Team: Opinion here. What feature would you like to see added to the teacher dashboard? A, percent of unit completed. B, notifications for new moderation flags, C, auto-graded projects, or D, something else. Other. Please write… if it's something else, please write it in the chat for us.


93
00:17:36.738 --> 00:17:40.888
CodeCombat Team: It looks like many people want to see the auto-graded projects.


94
00:17:42.748 --> 00:17:49.097
CodeCombat Team: Then percent of unit completed. After that, we have notifications for new moderation flags.


95
00:17:51.978 --> 00:17:57.338
CodeCombat Team: Thank you for sharing that. We'll definitely let our product team know.


96
00:18:03.788 --> 00:18:18.257
CodeCombat Team: And we have another poll here. What model would you like to see added to Hackstat? A, Imogen, B, Suno, C, V, O, D, something else? Keep in mind, we already have ChatGBT,


97
00:18:18.418 --> 00:18:25.077
CodeCombat Team: Google Gemini, Dolly 3, Cloud Sonnet, and Stable Diffusion. Let me launch that for you.


98
00:18:25.238 --> 00:18:28.018
CodeCombat Team: Please tell us what you would like to see added.


99
00:18:33.888 --> 00:18:37.787
CodeCombat Team: Looks like many people are interested in Suno.


100
00:18:40.058 --> 00:18:41.238
CodeCombat Team: Tuna's a great one.


101
00:18:41.968 --> 00:18:45.917
CodeCombat Team: We have VO in second place, Imogen…


102
00:18:47.568 --> 00:18:50.588
CodeCombat Team: Thank you all for sharing that information.


103
00:18:52.968 --> 00:19:01.238
CodeCombat Team: And… Let's see… I see writing assistance in the, chat as well. That's great, actually.


104
00:19:01.978 --> 00:19:13.707
CodeCombat Team: Perfect. Well, thanks, Gabby, for that fantastic presentation. So now that we've gone over the educator experience in Hackstack, it's time to see the student side of things. Let's experience the first lesson again, but this time through the lens of a student.


105
00:19:15.918 --> 00:19:36.727
CodeCombat Team: So Hackstack was designed for middle school and high school students. In addition to aligning a curriculum around the big standards like Common Core and NGSS, we are making sure that every lesson is also aligned with the Code Combat AI literacy skills for each grade level. This means that your students will learn important 21st century skills alongside the content-specific skills they need. With that in mind, let's take a look at our AI literacy framework.


106
00:19:39.958 --> 00:19:40.738
CodeCombat Team: So the f-


107
00:19:40.968 --> 00:19:56.488
CodeCombat Team: The framework is organized with one big idea per section, followed by three skill sets that support it. Each skill is then broken down into specific grade-level objectives, creating a complete K-12 pathway. There's also a Going Further section for students who want to challenge themselves beyond those core objectives.


108
00:19:59.908 --> 00:20:10.877
CodeCombat Team: Remember, every lesson follows a learn, remix, create structure, so with that in mind, let's complete each of these steps as a student. I'm now going to share my screen and hop into one of our first AI HackSec learning modules.


109
00:20:14.338 --> 00:20:16.158
CodeCombat Team: Oops, let's hop in here.


110
00:20:17.508 --> 00:20:28.988
CodeCombat Team: Perfect, so once AI Hackstack has been assigned to students, they can jump into the platform through the My Courses section of their student dashboard. As we come into the main AI Hackstack page, right away, there are two things worth noting on the left side of the screen.


111
00:20:28.988 --> 00:20:51.808
CodeCombat Team: The first is the My Creations tab here, where students can quickly access any projects they've worked on before, and second, we have the My Courses tab, where they can open or revisit courses and learning scenarios they've started or completed. On the right side, we see 9 different learning modules, each offering unique scenarios across a variety of subjects. For today's training, we'll head into the English Language Arts section, Module 2A, and open the first scenario, Dreams.


112
00:20:53.178 --> 00:21:07.588
CodeCombat Team: So when we select this module, you'll see the familiar Learn, Remix, and Create structure that runs across all HackStack scenarios. This consistency helps students quickly understand what's expected and gives them the tools they need to confidently create. Let's go ahead and hop into Dreams now.


113
00:21:10.308 --> 00:21:25.407
CodeCombat Team: So right upon entering the scenario, we're greeted by our teacher chatbot with a friendly welcome message. AI Hackstack lessons are delivered through chatbot interactions like this one, just like a common AI engine, making the experience authentic and familiar. Let's go ahead and click continue.


114
00:21:27.438 --> 00:21:29.598
CodeCombat Team: Alright, and upon… oops, sorry.


115
00:21:29.938 --> 00:21:34.778
CodeCombat Team: So, again, now we're given our first scenario, where we're greeted by our chatbot with


116
00:21:35.048 --> 00:21:41.738
CodeCombat Team: essentially an objective to read the first stanza of Langston Hughes' poem, Dreams. Hackstack is also going to provide…


117
00:21:42.278 --> 00:21:47.688
CodeCombat Team: provide us with a link where we can access that poem and we can read it. We'll go ahead and select that.


118
00:21:47.978 --> 00:21:49.817
CodeCombat Team: And let's take a look at the first stanza.


119
00:21:51.658 --> 00:21:57.597
CodeCombat Team: And it reads, Hold fast to dreams, for if dreams die, life is a broken-winged bird that cannot fly.


120
00:21:59.258 --> 00:22:03.448
CodeCombat Team: Perfect. So now back in Hackstack, and once we click continue.


121
00:22:04.078 --> 00:22:07.748
CodeCombat Team: We're gonna be told to prompt the AI to illustrate that stanza.


122
00:22:07.788 --> 00:22:09.467
CodeCombat Team: Let's go ahead and continue again.


123
00:22:09.468 --> 00:22:28.958
CodeCombat Team: So, in the Learn portion, students are provided with multiple pre-written prompts to help guide their AI interactions. These scenarios are real AI engines, in this case, Dolly 3. Students are given several prompt options here. They can revisit the stanza as well by either tabbing back over to that same tab that they have it open, or by selecting that link they were previously provided.


124
00:22:29.008 --> 00:22:36.538
CodeCombat Team: So let's go ahead and experiment here. Let's say we want to choose something maybe a bit vague or incorrect, like this short prompt here, create an image of a bird.


125
00:22:36.988 --> 00:22:53.558
CodeCombat Team: Immediately, Hackstack is going to flag it. It's going to explain why it's not strong enough and how to improve that. So this feedback helps students develop better prompting skills overall. Let's go ahead and see this example in the bottom prompt here. Create an image of a sad Langston Hughes holding a bird in its hands.


126
00:22:55.578 --> 00:23:06.077
CodeCombat Team: And again, we're going to reach that flag, but this one is actually going to be flagging it for not only copyright purposes, but also AI efficacy in terms of using the likeness of a specific person.


127
00:23:06.508 --> 00:23:09.717
CodeCombat Team: Let's go ahead and use the correct prompt as well.


128
00:23:10.258 --> 00:23:16.388
CodeCombat Team: Which is, create a gloomy, Sorry, create a gloomy black and white image of a bird that cannot fly.


129
00:23:18.088 --> 00:23:19.008
CodeCombat Team: Alright.


130
00:23:19.968 --> 00:23:36.837
CodeCombat Team: Click continue here. So now Hackstack has generated a striking image that captures the Sansa's mood perfectly, and beneath that image, we have a link that the students can copy and use in other projects, plus a caption showing the exact language used to create it, which reinforces the descriptive prompts that lead to better results.


131
00:23:37.218 --> 00:23:38.788
CodeCombat Team: Go ahead and click continue.


132
00:23:42.178 --> 00:23:50.637
CodeCombat Team: Next, the chatbot is going to introduce Part 2, and it's essentially going to ask us if we knew that using the same prompt can actually produce a different result.


133
00:23:52.888 --> 00:23:56.278
CodeCombat Team: So now we're instructed to select the same prompt and see how things change.


134
00:23:58.838 --> 00:23:59.888
CodeCombat Team: So again.


135
00:24:00.438 --> 00:24:15.737
CodeCombat Team: We're going to have multiple choice options as a student here. Let's say the student isn't quite paying attention, or maybe lost a little bit of attention along the way and selects the incorrect prompt. Again, we're going to get that flag, which in this case is going to flag it for being inappropriate, since it's actually


136
00:24:15.738 --> 00:24:24.018
CodeCombat Team: Trying to prompt a gory image of a bird that's dying, but let's go ahead and select the correct answer here. Create a gloomy black and white image of a bird that cannot fly.


137
00:24:27.658 --> 00:24:39.017
CodeCombat Team: Alright, so we use the same prompt again, and this time it gets… we get a very different image. So, an empty field with a sad ostrich this time. This teaches students that they can rerun prompts for variety until they get what they want.


138
00:24:42.378 --> 00:24:50.028
CodeCombat Team: And at the end of this section, the chatbot is going to encourage reflection before moving on to the next phase, illustrating the second stanza.


139
00:24:52.498 --> 00:24:55.298
CodeCombat Team: So we'll click continue here, we'll get a bit more dialogue.


140
00:24:56.688 --> 00:25:00.847
CodeCombat Team: And again, we're going to be provided that link to the Langston Hughes poem as well.


141
00:25:02.128 --> 00:25:10.578
CodeCombat Team: And now we're gonna have the option that leads to our next remix segment, so we're gonna go ahead and select Next Level to enter that remix segment of this.


142
00:25:10.748 --> 00:25:11.788
CodeCombat Team: Scenario.


143
00:25:13.598 --> 00:25:24.038
CodeCombat Team: So now we enter the remix segment. This is where the training wheels come off, and students write their own prompts from scratch. So, again, we're going to revisit that same prompt, or I'm sorry, that same poem.


144
00:25:24.158 --> 00:25:32.167
CodeCombat Team: And if we go up here, we can go ahead and take a look at it. It says, hold fast to dreams for when dreams go. Life is a barren field frozen with snow.


145
00:25:34.068 --> 00:25:36.497
CodeCombat Team: And then we're gonna hop back here and click continue.


146
00:25:39.728 --> 00:25:53.767
CodeCombat Team: Alright, so again, we get to revisit that poem, and now we're tasked with prompting directly here as the student. So now we have full reign in terms of where we're going to prompt, so in this case, let's go ahead and write the prompt. Create an image of a desolate


147
00:25:55.188 --> 00:25:57.087
CodeCombat Team: Field of Snow?


148
00:25:58.408 --> 00:26:00.688
CodeCombat Team: Oh, let's make some easy little corrections here.


149
00:26:01.208 --> 00:26:04.338
CodeCombat Team: The image should be dark.


150
00:26:05.668 --> 00:26:06.888
CodeCombat Team: And gloomy.


151
00:26:07.588 --> 00:26:09.058
CodeCombat Team: Let's see what this produces.


152
00:26:11.418 --> 00:26:29.888
CodeCombat Team: All right, and now, while that loads, there's a couple of things we can take note of. One is that we see that there is a credit deposit here, essentially, or a credit pool here beneath the prompt window. So, each student is given 30 prompt credits per week, and this encourages them to be intentional in detailing in their wording, or as detailed


153
00:26:29.888 --> 00:26:45.357
CodeCombat Team: in the wording as possible. And now we can see we've now produced a brand new image of an empty field of snow. It's a really pretty image of this subject, and it could work, but let's say maybe we're not satisfied with that image, maybe we want to do it again. So let's go ahead and copy what we previously pasted.


154
00:26:47.678 --> 00:26:49.497
CodeCombat Team: And we'll go ahead and paste that again.


155
00:26:50.348 --> 00:26:56.388
CodeCombat Team: And we'll let Hackstack take some moments here to create a new image for us, and let's see if we can get something that we like a little bit better.


156
00:27:03.868 --> 00:27:05.257
CodeCombat Team: We'll just give that a moment.


157
00:27:06.948 --> 00:27:25.508
CodeCombat Team: Alright, now as we can see, even using the same prompt again in the remix function allows us to get a completely different image. So students really have complete creative control here when it comes to their prompting, and they can produce dramatically different results across the board, which in the classroom can obviously be a lot of fun for students to be able to share with their classmates and their peers.


158
00:27:26.908 --> 00:27:51.818
CodeCombat Team: And at this point, this basically leads us to the end of the remix section. So, at this point, students can now select this next level, which essentially is going to take them to the Create segment, where students combine what they've learned and build something entirely on their own, through the guidance of learning objectives included in our lesson slides and lesson plans. But before we wrap up, let's go ahead and revisit the student safety features. So once students have free reign over


159
00:27:51.818 --> 00:28:01.478
CodeCombat Team: prompting. Obviously, we want to ensure that they stay appropriate with their prompting as well. So let's go ahead and test it out from the student perspective again. I'll go ahead and create a prompt here saying.


160
00:28:01.708 --> 00:28:04.058
CodeCombat Team: Create an image… Whoops.


161
00:28:06.678 --> 00:28:11.488
CodeCombat Team: Of a, let's say, gory bird, Dead in a field.


162
00:28:14.618 --> 00:28:37.967
CodeCombat Team: And it can. Immediately, we're going to get that flag, and it's going to break that down in terms of why that's inappropriate. It's also going to deduct one of those prompt credits, teaching students to be really thoughtful about their choices moving forward. And with that, that leads to the end of the Hackstack workflow, guiding students from structured learning, remixing, to creating independently, all while reinforcing safe, ethical, and effective AI use.


163
00:28:41.478 --> 00:28:42.268
CodeCombat Team: Whoops.


164
00:28:43.188 --> 00:29:04.267
CodeCombat Team: So again, that brings us to the first Hackstack lesson through the student experience, but every lesson follows the same learn, remix, and create model to reinforce the concepts taught, so there's going to be plenty of room for discussion between each learning module in the lesson material to reinforce your student's understanding of AI and the roles it can play in their lives. So with that in mind, let's take a look at some examples of completed student projects in AI Hackstack.


165
00:29:06.138 --> 00:29:13.297
CodeCombat Team: Here are a few examples of the projects students have created with Hackstack. Let's go ahead and take a closer look at this recycling app another student has created.


166
00:29:17.148 --> 00:29:42.117
CodeCombat Team: So as we step into the student's project, you may notice a few differences from the last scenario. In this case, the student used ChatGPT4 rather than Dolly 3 to create a unique app that determines whether a provided image is recyclable. So since the student's goal was to build an app, Hacksack produced code instead of an image. Here, we're going to be able to see a description of what the student instructed the AI to create. We're going to be given a clipboardable HTML code that it produces


167
00:29:42.118 --> 00:29:53.567
CodeCombat Team: We're also going to be given access to edit that code if students want to make edits as they move forward. And finally, we're also going to be given the output feature to preview the current build. So let's go ahead and select output and see that result.


168
00:29:56.088 --> 00:30:06.388
CodeCombat Team: And as we can see here, we have a rather simple but effective app in terms of classifying what can be recycled and what can't based on an image upload. Let's go ahead and test this out and see if it works.


169
00:30:09.188 --> 00:30:17.157
CodeCombat Team: Choose a file. And I'm just going to go ahead and select an image of a Coke can here. Should be easy enough. Let's see if it actually classifies it correctly.


170
00:30:19.428 --> 00:30:35.588
CodeCombat Team: And it looks like it is, in fact, recyclable, so it's amazing that it's already detecting, and they were able to create such an app so powerful in a matter of minutes by simply using prompting an AI Hackstack. But let's go ahead and test it a little bit further. Maybe let's use something with a similar color, but different properties.


171
00:30:37.938 --> 00:30:50.898
CodeCombat Team: And again, it looks like the app itself is working, so now we can see that students can really drive lasting results, and they can produce a lot of really powerful, different creations through using their own activity.


172
00:30:51.598 --> 00:31:09.088
CodeCombat Team: So we're gonna go ahead and exit and return to Hackstack here. From here, students can continue refining those projects, they can adjust the fonts, the colors and functionality, or make other UI improvements, until they're satisfied with their creations. So this example, again, really shows how powerful Hackstack can be, and just how creative students can become when they're given the right tools.


173
00:31:12.248 --> 00:31:31.877
CodeCombat Team: And that brings us to our fourth and final poll of the day. So again, there's no right or wrong answer to this poll, we just want to know your opinion. What makes you most nervous about your students using AI HalfStack? Would it be, A, inappropriate requests, B, cheating, C, sharing PII, or other, which we'd ask you to include in the chat?


174
00:31:35.858 --> 00:31:44.488
CodeCombat Team: It looks like most people are concerned with cheating, inappropriate requests, sharing PII.


175
00:31:46.598 --> 00:31:51.298
CodeCombat Team: And then, we have a teacher saying students just clicking through.


176
00:31:52.238 --> 00:32:03.357
CodeCombat Team: That's a good point, Trevor. One thing I do want to note is that in terms of the multiple choice and more the click-through material in Hackstack, that's more going to be focused along the learning segment of the portion of, …


177
00:32:03.358 --> 00:32:26.617
CodeCombat Team: the scenarios themselves. So they are going to be given those training wheels so that they can really kind of better be corralled into the right answer in terms of prompting. But from that point, they're going to be given free rein within the remix and the create functions in the scenarios of those AI hackstack to be able to really take what they learn, followed by the instruction that's given in the lesson slides and lesson plans, and apply that to creating their own


178
00:32:26.618 --> 00:32:28.138
CodeCombat Team: Creations from scratch.


179
00:32:31.948 --> 00:32:44.108
CodeCombat Team: Close to cheating, but just making sure they learn that this should supplement learning, not replace doing your work. Absolutely. AI efficacy is definitely something that we're mindful of, and we want to reinforce that in the classroom as well.


180
00:32:51.238 --> 00:32:52.707
CodeCombat Team: Great question.


181
00:32:54.938 --> 00:32:56.838
CodeCombat Team: Thanks so much for your guys' responses.


182
00:33:01.138 --> 00:33:22.778
CodeCombat Team: Alright, so that brings us to the end of today's AI Hackstack training. If you felt the training was informative and want to dive even deeper, we do offer AI HackStack professional development workshops. So here are just a few examples of the PD your staff can complete through our AIPD series. Again, please don't hesitate to reach out if you want to know more. You're welcome to email us at AI at codecombat.com for any additional information.


183
00:33:24.598 --> 00:33:42.277
CodeCombat Team: And that brings us to the questions segment. So, does anyone have any questions? If so, feel free to write them in the chat or the QA section of the webinar. We're going to provide plenty of time for you guys to write out your questions, and hopefully we can answer them in a timely manner before the end of this webinar. But feel free to drop those in the chat so that we can address those for you.


184
00:33:45.978 --> 00:33:51.168
CodeCombat Team: I see someone was asking for that link again, so I'm searching for it, I'm gonna drop it…


185
00:33:52.258 --> 00:33:53.647
CodeCombat Team: In the chat.


186
00:33:58.218 --> 00:34:01.978
CodeCombat Team: And Gail, I see that you missed the Google Docs, but it looks like we sent…


187
00:34:02.218 --> 00:34:03.897
CodeCombat Team: A link there for ya.


188
00:34:12.908 --> 00:34:35.508
CodeCombat Team: So, in terms of Hackstack licensing, Hackstack does come completely accessible to those who have student licenses across the board with our Code Combat, Osaria, Code Combat Junior, and all of our other products that we offer as well. It essentially is a one-size-fits-all license that applies to all of our products. However, we do also offer specific AI Hackstack licensing for any who are interested in AI Hackstack specifically.


189
00:34:39.878 --> 00:34:59.168
CodeCombat Team: Melanie, you will not need a separate license. You're actually going to be able to use the same licenses that you are currently using with your students. That's going to give you complete access to assign Hackstack as a course to your students. And again, we do also offer the first module of Hackstack free to trial for anyone who is unlicensed, so you guys will have access to kind of explore that first module.


190
00:35:02.768 --> 00:35:07.188
CodeCombat Team: Phillip, are you saying the tiny URL link is not working?


191
00:35:09.038 --> 00:35:10.667
CodeCombat Team: Please let me know.


192
00:35:14.468 --> 00:35:19.038
CodeCombat Team: Cold Comma does have an esports league?


193
00:35:19.168 --> 00:35:29.578
CodeCombat Team: It is separate. We have our Code Combat, which is a core coding program that teaches coding, and we do have a separate esports league as well.


194
00:35:40.898 --> 00:36:04.577
CodeCombat Team: The best way, Terry, would be to go to our schools page. That's the one resource that we could give you outside of just reaching out to us, and we're happy to go ahead and either advocate on your behalf in terms of pitching to an admin or anyone regarding the money decisions.
