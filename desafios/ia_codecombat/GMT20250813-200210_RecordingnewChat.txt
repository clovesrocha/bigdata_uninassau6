00:29:42	Trevor Doyle:	Are you saying Hackstack would be the complete class for the semester?
00:31:16	Sonia Spindt:	A self-paced completion of HackStack is about ~1 semester. If you are using the lesson plans too, it should take ~1 year because of the unplugged activities.
00:32:31	Terri Holmes:	Writing assistance
00:34:16	Melissa Hirt:	can you explain the structure
00:34:23	Melissa Hirt:	module...lesson...?
00:36:12	Sonia Spindt:	Each lesson is 3 levels in a HackStack module (learn-remix-create).
00:37:17	Caroline DeVoe:	Very interesting. A big challenge is teaching children to utilize AI as a tool to extend our learning and thinking, and not supplant it.
00:37:38	Trevor Doyle:	is it generated live or are these images from your server for the lesson?
00:38:01	Laura Ezell:	I apologize, I had to step out several times because students kept stepping in to ask questions for schedule changes.  May I get an invite for another time? I have missed quite a bit.
00:38:06	David Chiappone:	How are accounts for the various AI tools managed? Does each student need to create their own?
00:38:20	Ridwan Olawale:	I missed the google docs link that was sent earlier , could it be resent please?
00:38:39	Sonia Spindt:	All AI output is pre-baked for the “learn” levels. They are generated live for “remix” and “create” levels.

00:38:56	Trevor Doyle:	wait, it flags when a student click a prompt you provided?
00:39:33	Sonia Spindt:	Yes, if it’s an incorrect prompt
00:39:40	Terri Holmes:	Are any of the programs in code combat free, or just module 1 of AI Hackstack
00:41:04	Sonia Spindt:	David, if I understand your question correctly, then no, students do not need to create accounts for each AI tool. All they need to do is join one of your AI HackStack classrooms.
00:41:08	Daniel Sanchez:	Is there a resource where I can find the standards and objectives covered by each lesson?
00:41:19	Trevor Doyle:	No, I mean would that send Flag warning to the teacher = red box
00:42:13	Fammi Ochungo:	What's my role as the teacher. only to set up the class and course?
00:43:49	Sonia Spindt:	Daniel, you will find them listed at the end of each lesson.

00:45:33	Terri Holmes:	Becoming too dependent on AI
00:45:34	Susan Murray:	I’m not nervous
00:45:43	David Chiappone:	close to cheating but just making sure they learn that this should supplement learning not replace doing your work
00:45:49	Alasdair Shaw:	D: pupils not engaging their brains or understanding hiw things actually work
00:46:23	Terri Holmes:	How do we define cheating in today’s world?
