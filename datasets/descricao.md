# Por que medir a inteligência das cidades?
Why measure cities’ smartness?
IMD produces a yearly Smart City Index offering a balanced focus on economic and technological aspects of smart cities on the one hand, and “humane dimensions” of smart cities (quality of life, environment, and inclusiveness) on the other.

In this sixth edition, survey answers to the question “Is finding housing with rent equal to or less than 30% of the average monthly salary a problem in your city?” shape the dialogue. The new cities added this year are: AlUla in Saudi Arabia, Astana in Kazakhstan, Caracas in Venezuela, Kuwait City in Kuwait, Manama in Bahrain, and San Juan in Puerto Rico – bringing this year’s total to 146.
